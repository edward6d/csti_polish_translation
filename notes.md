# Translator's notes

## Translation choices

- Mushroom Bed - to było niezłe wyzwanie, nie znalazłem żadnego dobrego polskiego odpowiednika. Stanęło na "skrzynka do hodowli grzybów"
- Seahound -> Morski Ogar - zdecydowałem się to przetłumaczyć jako nazwę własną. Ogar pasuje, bo to też stworzenie mackowe jak Ogary z Tindalos

## Grammatical gender and suggestions for next titles

In Polish knowing the grammatical gender of the speaker is very important for being able to properly construct sentences. To illustrate:

1. I do X - ungendered
2. I did X - gendered
3. X was done - ungendered
4. Done: X - ungendered
With adjectives it gets worse:
5. I am thirsty - gendered
6. I was thirsty - gendered
7. I feel thirst - ungendered
8. I felt thirst - gendered

Some lazy translations default to male gender of the player, but I refuse to do that. So unfortunately I was limited to forms 1,3,4 and 7 in my translation, which sometimes ended up sounding a bit artificial. Especially log entries suffered from this, sounding very formal and unnatural. Stuff like "You fell and got yourself some ugly scrapes..." had to become "Fall! You get a few new scrapes on your body."
